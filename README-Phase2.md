## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

### Backend Testing:

□ Google Apps Script deploys without errors  
□ Web App URL returns JSON status when visited  
□ `setupSpreadsheet()` function creates proper sheet structure  
□ `testSubmission()` function adds data to sheet

### Integration Testing:

□ Forms submit data successfully to Google Sheets  
□ Both tutor and community submissions work  
□ Anonymous submissions (blank name) work correctly  
□ Named submissions preserve the name  
□ Timestamps are accurate  
□ Categories are assigned correctly

### Error Handling:

□ Offline detection works (test with airplane mode)  
□ Retry logic attempts failed submissions  
□ Clear error messages for different failure types  
□ Graceful fallback when Google Sheets is unavailable

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### "Configuration error" message:

- Check that `config.js` has the correct Web App URL
- Ensure the URL starts with `https://script.google.com/macros/s/`

### CORS errors:

- Verify Web App is deployed with "Anyone" access
- Make sure you're using the Web App URL, not the script editor URL

### Submissions not appearing in sheets:

- Check Google Apps Script logs for errors
- Verify the sheet name is exactly "Feedback_Responses"
- Run the `testSubmission()` function manually

### Categories seem wrong:

- Use `test-integration.html` to test categorization
- Adjust keywords in the categorization function if needed

Test on actual mobile devices:
□ Forms load quickly on mobile data  
□ Submission works on both WiFi and cellular  
□ Error messages are readable on small screens
